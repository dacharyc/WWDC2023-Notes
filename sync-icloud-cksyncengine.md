## Sync to iCloud with CKSyncEngine

Presenters:
- Tim Mahoney, CloudKit Engineer
- Aamer Husain, CloudKit Engineer

New CloudKit API called CKSyncEngine

## The State of Sync

- Sync is expected with new apps

"Syncing in general is hard."

- `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer`: Full-stack solution that includes local persistence
- `CKSyncEngine`: BYO local persistence (NEW!) - sync with CloudKit but not using NSPersistentCloudKitContainer
- `CKDatabase` and `CKOperation`: More fine-grained control
